# Configuration

It is generally a good practise to extract configuration to a singe source such as a config file. However it
tends to become quite complex when dealing with multiple environments and also when parts of configuration needs
to be exposed during build time or even dynamic when toggling settings and feature flags in [dev settings](dev-settings.md).
