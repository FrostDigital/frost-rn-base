# 🐣 Dev Settings 🐣

In many cases there is a good idea to have a hidden "dev settings" screen where developers or super users
can toggle configuration, such as toggling feature flags, point to test or prod environment.

The dev setting screen is normally hidden behind a long tap on a button and can sometimes have a pin code to
further secure it.
